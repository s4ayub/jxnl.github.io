# About

I've done graphic design (check out my dribbble for old scraps), worked at Canada's National Laboratory for Particle Physics, and studied art, physics and mathematics. All of them focus on one thing, understanding a system, and communicating it outwards.

Data science is no different.

I want to do well for myself and do good for others. I created [Data Hackers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/541448455986568/) to help the College Hackathon community learn more about data science and machine learning.

Oh yeah, and you can reach me at [jason@jxnl.co](mailto:jason@jxnl.co).
