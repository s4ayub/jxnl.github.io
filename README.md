# About

I created and organize [Data Hackers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/541448455986568/) which is collective of 2500+ people interesting in discussing data science and helping eachother get smarter everyday. I'm interested in getting people excited about thinking quantitatively and leveraging our tools to tackle interesting problems, big or small.

Oh yeah, and you can reach me at [jason@jxnl.co](mailto:jason@jxnl.co).
